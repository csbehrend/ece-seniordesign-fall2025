# Distribution Plans

## App Subsystem
The application is developed in Android Studio using Kotlin and will be distributed to team members for testing purposes via GitHub.  
During development, APK builds will be generated for testing on physical Android devices, such as tablets. 
For final deployment, the app will be packaged as an APK for installation on Android devices.
The app interacts with the communications and controls subsystem via Bluetooth, allowing users to send commands and receive data.
