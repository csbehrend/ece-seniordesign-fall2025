# Distribution Plans

## App Subsystem
The application is developed in Android Studio using Kotlin and will be distributed to team members via GitHub.  
During later stages of development, APK builds will be generated for testing on a physical Android tablet. 
For final deployment, the app will be packaged as an APK for installation on Android devices.
The app interacts with the communications and controls subsystem via Bluetooth, allowing users to send commands and receive data.
